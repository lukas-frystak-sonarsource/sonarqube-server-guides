# When to deploy SonarQube Server on Kubernetes (and when not)

Deploying SonarQube Server on a Kubernetes cluster via the official Helm charts is a fully supported and increasingly common approach.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SonarQube Server is a self-hosted application, which relies on databases and Elasticsearch, and its successful deployment relies heavily on robust internal support and specific expertise. While the Helm chart simplifies the process, managing a stateful application like SonarQube within the dynamic Kubernetes environment introduces complexities. Organizations should carefully consider alternatives if they lack sufficient Kubernetes experience or internal support resources. It is crucial to note that the Sonar team's support is focused on the core application and the use of the Helm chart as-is. They are unable to assist with the customization of the Helm chart to suit specific customer environments or with troubleshooting issues arising from such modifications, as these fall outside our area of expertise regarding your unique infrastructure. Therefore, the decision to install SonarQube Server on  Kubernetes should be based on the organization's capacity to manage the underlying Kubernetes environment.
