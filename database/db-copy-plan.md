# Database Vendor Migration Plan

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive plan for migrating a SonarQube Server database from one database engine to another (e.g., from Microsoft SQL Server to PostgreSQL). While the official [SonarQube Server DB Copy Tool documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/server-update-and-maintenance/maintenance/sonarqube-db-copy-tool) focuses on the technical usage of the DB Copy Tool, this guide expands on the official documentation to provide a complete migration strategy that minimizes risks and downtime.

## Why Migration Planning Matters

Database engine migration is a significant undertaking that requires careful planning due to several critical factors:

- **Production downtime**: The migration process requires SonarQube Server to be offline, directly impacting development teams
- **Data validation requirements**: Moving large datasets between different database engines requires thorough validation to ensure successful data transfer
- **Performance implications**: Different database engines may have varying performance characteristics that need to be validated
- **Rollback complexity**: Once migration begins, reverting to the original database requires careful preparation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Downtime and risks are minimized through thorough planning, testing, and validation. This document provides a structured approach to achieve a successful migration.

> [!NOTE]
> This migration plan provides general guidance and best practices. Users should exercise their own judgment when following and executing the plan, adapting it as necessary to meet their organization's specific requirements, policies, and technical constraints.

## Migration Strategy Overview

The migration follows a two-phase approach to ensure success and minimize production risks:

### Phase 1: Testing Environment Migration
- Validate the migration process in a representative test environment
- Identify and resolve potential issues before production execution
- Establish performance baselines and validate improvements
- Fine-tune the migration process and timing
- Verify production readiness through repeated testing cycles

The migration process should be tested at least once to review, understand, and fine-tune the process. Then, it should be tested again to validate the process and verify its production readiness. Once fully validated, the process can be applied in production.

### Phase 2: Production Migration
- Execute the validated migration process in production
- Apply lessons learned from testing phase
- Monitor and validate the production migration
- Monitor the system for some time after completing the migration and bringing the SonarQube Server instance back online.

### Success Criteria
A successful migration is defined by:
- Complete data transfer with integrity validation
- SonarQube Server functionality verification
- Performance meeting or exceeding the baseline performance of the original database
- Minimal actual downtime within planned maintenance window

## Phase 1: Testing Environment Migration

### Prerequisites

Before starting the testing migration, ensure you have:

1. **Representative test environment**: 
   - SonarQube Server deployed using the same method as production (containers, VMs, etc.)
   - Equivalent hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage)
   - Same database service type and tier as production

2. **Production data backup**: 
   - Complete database dump/backup from production
   - Verified backup integrity
   - Backup restored to test environment

3. **Network access**: 
   - Connectivity between migration tool and both source and target databases
   - Appropriate firewall rules and database permissions configured

4. **Performance baseline**: 
   - Document current SonarQube Server performance metrics
   - Identify key performance indicators to track

### Technical Migration Process (Test)

#### DB Copy Tool Overview

The DB Copy Tool is a Java command line application that enables data migration between different database engines. The tool connects to both the source database (original) and target database (new engine) to transfer all SonarQube Server data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> During the DB Copy Tool execution, no SonarQube Server instances can be connected to either database (source or target).

#### Step-by-Step Execution

The migration process involves these key steps:

1. **Prepare target database**: Set up the new database engine with appropriate configuration
2. **Initialize schema**: Start a separate SonarQube Server instance (same version and edition) against the empty target database to populate the schema
3. **Stop SonarQube Server**: Ensure no active connections to either database
4. **Execute DB Copy Tool**: Run the tool to transfer data from source to target
5. **Validate data transfer**: Verify that the DB copy tool finished succesfully. Verify there are not warnings or errors in the log.

The technical execution can be performed on:
- A virtual machine with network access to both databases
- A container environment
- [A Kubernetes cluster](db-copy-tool-on-kubernetes.md) (convenient if SonarQube Server already runs on a Kubernetes cluster)

#### Validation and Verification

After the test migration:
1. **Update SonarQube Server configuration**: Configure SonarQube Server to connect to the new target database
2. **Clear Elasticsearch data**: Remove the contents of the Elasticsearch directory as described in [Forcing an Elasticsearch reindex](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/server-update-and-maintenance/maintenance/reindexing#forcing-es-reindex)
3. **Start SonarQube Server** connected to the new database
4. **Verify functionality**: Test key features and user workflows
5. **Data integrity checks**: Validate that all projects, users, and analysis data are present
6. **Performance testing**: Compare performance against baseline metrics
7. **Document findings**: Record any issues, performance changes, and process improvements

## Phase 2: Production Migration

### Pre-migration Checklist

Before executing the production migration:

- [ ] Test migration completed successfully with documented results
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled and communicated to stakeholders
- [ ] Production database backup created and verified
- [ ] Target database environment provisioned and configured
- [ ] Migration tools and scripts prepared and tested
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested
- [ ] Monitoring and validation procedures defined
- [ ] Team assignments and communication plan established

### Technical Migration Process (Production)

The production migration follows the same technical steps validated in the testing phase:

1. **Announce maintenance window**: Notify users of the planned downtime
2. **Create final production backup**: Ensure you have a complete, verified backup for rollback if needed
3. **Stop SonarQube Server**: Gracefully shut down the production instance
4. **Execute validated migration process**: Follow the exact steps tested in Phase 1
5. **Monitor progress**: Track migration progress and watch for any issues
6. **Validate migration**: Perform the same validation steps used in testing

### Go-live Procedures

After successful migration:
1. **Start SonarQube Server** with the new database
2. **Perform smoke tests**: Verify basic functionality
3. **Monitor performance**: Track system performance closely
4. **Communicate completion**: Notify stakeholders that the system is available
5. **Monitor for issues**: Maintain increased monitoring for the first 24-48 hours

## Post-Migration

### Performance Verification
- Monitor key performance metrics for at least one week
- Compare against pre-migration baselines
- Address any performance regressions identified

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
- Connection string configuration
- Database permission issues
- Performance tuning for the new database engine
- Character encoding or collation differences

### Rollback Strategy

The rollback strategy is straightforward and relies on keeping the original/source database online and unchanged throughout the migration process. Since the original database remains in the exact state it was when SonarQube Server was last connected to it, no data restoration is required.

To rollback to the original database, simply revert the SonarQube Server configuration changes made during migration, specifically the database connection string and authentication credentials.

If issues are identified during or after migration:
1. Stop the SonarQube Server instance connected to the new database
2. Update SonarQube Server configuration to use the original database connection details
3. Clear Elasticsearch data: Remove the contents of the Elasticsearch directory as described in [Forcing an Elasticsearch reindex](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/server-update-and-maintenance/maintenance/reindexing#forcing-es-reindex)
4. Start SonarQube Server - it will reconnect to the original database
5. Validate that system functionality is restored
6. Analyze the migration issues and plan remediation for the next migration attempt
